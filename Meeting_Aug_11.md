## Starting Trouble
- Meeting was scheduled at 20:00 on August 11th (97th Avenue).
- One person showed up.

## Discussion
- The initial discussion mostly revolved around academics and personal interests. The discussion of MathSoc as a club came more emphasised in the last 10â€“20 minutes.
- One suggestion that was given was that the meeting should have been more publicized. Currently, it was only known to members within the Signal group. In upcoming events, there should be a poster with a short writeup intended to be shared in WhatsApp and college mail.

## Future of MathSoc
- There were 3 main points that we've discussed.
- **First:** We're planning to participate in competitions (and hopefully win a few!)
  - Main competitions include:
    - Simon Marais Mathematics Competition (SMMC)
    - NSUCRYPTO
    - The University Physics Competition (UPC)
    - Indian Young Physicists' League (IYPL)  
    Apart from GATE, JAM, and JEST.
- **Second:** There are plans for inductions after the B25s join, as the club is currently run by a small group, which is starting to impact growth and reach.
  - Through the induction, we aim to assign people responsible for different sections of MathSoc:
    - Math section
    - Physics section
    - Quant/Cryptography section  
    (with the possibility of extending this upon further discussion)
- **Third:** Upon inducting people, the aim is to avoid a hierarchy for the roles.  
  I personally think the ones who are more interested and experienced in their respective domains should take responsibility, regardless of their year.
  - Example: A first-year can be responsible for Quant and Crypto events/competitions if they show interest and are competent.
